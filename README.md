- Use the search bar to filter transactions by sender, receiver, cause, or transaction ID.
- Press **Search** or hit **Enter** to apply the filter.

### Pagination
- Use the **Prev** and **Next** buttons at the bottom to navigate between pages of transactions.

### Theme Toggling

## Security: API Credentials

- **API keys and secrets are never exposed to the browser.**
- All requests to YaYa Wallet's REST API are made via server-side API routes (in `/app/api/transactions`).
- API credentials are stored in environment variables (e.g., `.env.local`) and only used server-side.
- **Never commit `.env.local` or credentials to version control.**

## Customization
- You can change the default account, theme, or table columns in the code as needed.
- The UI is built with React and Tailwind CSS for easy customization.
